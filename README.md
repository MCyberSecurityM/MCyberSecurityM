I am a cybersecurity enthusiast pursuing a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity at the University of Phoenix, set to graduate in May 2025. My primary focus is on penetration testing, where I utilize tools like Kali Linux and Nmap to identify and address vulnerabilities. Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I engage with platforms like LetsDefend and Hack The Box to stay current with evolving security threats.

## Objective

To apply my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity to contribute effectively to the protection of digital environments. I aim to leverage my expertise in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment to enhance organizational security and advance in the field of cybersecurity.
